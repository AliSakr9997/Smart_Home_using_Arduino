# Arduino-Based Multi-Function Home Automation Project

## üåü Project Overview  
This project implements a multi-functional home automation system using Arduino. It integrates various sensors and actuators to automate and simplify daily tasks.

### ‚ú® Features  
1. **LED Brightness Control**  
   - Adjusts LED brightness inversely to light intensity using an LDR.  

2. **Servo Motor Control**  
   - Operates doors using two IR sensors and a keypad for input.  

3. **Temperature Monitoring**  
   - Activates a fan when the temperature exceeds a threshold.  
   - Triggers a buzzer alarm for high temperatures, resettable via a push button.  

4. **LCD Display**  
   - Real-time display of temperature, brightness, and password validation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
1. **LDR-Based LED Control**:  
   - The LDR measures ambient light intensity, and the LED brightness is adjusted inversely using PWM signals.  

2. **IR and Servo Control**:  
   - Two IR sensors control the servo motor's movement in response to object detection.  

3. **Temperature Monitoring**:  
   - Activates a fan for temperature regulation.  
   - Triggers an alarm if the temperature exceeds a high threshold until manually reset.  

4. **LCD Display**:  
   - Displays temperature, brightness, and password-related messages.
